# STM32H743I-EVAL_BSP-CI

This is the development repository for the **STMicroelectronics STM32H743I-EVAL Board Support Pack (BSP)** - a CMSIS software pack that is designed to work with all compiler toolchains (Arm Compiler and GCC,). It is released as [CMSIS software pack](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/stm32h743i-eval_bsp-keil) and therefore accessible by CMSIS-Pack enabled software development tools.

This BSP uses the generator integration of the [CMSIS-Toolbox to Configure STM32 Devices with CubeMX](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/blob/main/docs/CubeMX.md) that is also supported in ÂµVision 5.40 an higher.

> **Note:** This is currently Work in Progress. Final release is expected in Q3'2024.

## Usage

This BSP requires the [Device Family Pack (DFP) for the STM32H7 series](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/STM32H7xx_DFP) as well as the [CMSIS-Driver Interface to STM32 HAL](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/CMSIS-Driver_STM32)

- [Examples/Blinky](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/STM32H743I-EVAL_BSP/tree/main/Examples/Blinky) shows the usage in a [*csolution project*](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/STM32H743I-EVAL_BSP/blob/main/Examples/Blinky/Blinky.csolution.yml).
  
- [Board Layers](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/STM32H743I-EVAL_BSP/tree/main/Layers) are designed for [Reference Applications](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/blob/main/docs/ReferenceApplications.md) and allow to run various device-agnostic examples on this board.

The device is configured for this board using [STM32CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html). For additional information refer to:

- [CMSIS-Toolbox - Configure STM32 Devices with CubeMX](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/blob/main/docs/CubeMX.md) for usage information of STM32CubeMX with CMSIS projects.

## Using the development repository

This development repository can be used in a local directory and [mapped as software pack](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/blob/main/docs/build-tools.md#install-a-repository) using for example `cpackget` with:

    cpackget add <path>/Keil.STM32H743I-EVAL_BSP.pdsc

## Generate software pack

The software pack is generated using bash shell scripts.

- `./gen_pack.sh` based on [Open-CMSIS-Pack/gen-pack](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/gen-pack)
generates the software pack. Run this script locally with:

      STM32H743I-EVAL_BSP $ ./gen_pack.sh

### GitHub Actions

The repository uses GitHub Actions to generate the pack and build examples:

- `.github/workflows/pack.yml` based on [Open-CMSIS-Pack/gen-pack-action](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/gen-pack-action) generates pack using the [Generate software pack](#generate-software-pack) scripts.
- `.github/workflows/Test-Examples.yml` builds the `BSP` examples.
- `.github/workflows/Test-RefExamples.yml` builds the `Middleware` examples, which are board and device agnostic, by using the `Board-Layer` for adaptation.

The `Test-Examples.yml` and `Test-RefExamples.yml` actions are executed periodically one a week. They will be also executed after pushing or pulling the repository. These actions performs a build operation by using the `AC6` and the `GCC` compiler.
